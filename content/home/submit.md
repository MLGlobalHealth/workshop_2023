This workshop will start a lasting and consistent effort to close the gap between advances in machine learning, practitioners and policy makers working in public health globally. It will focus on difficult public health problems and relevant machine learning and statistical methods, which includes but is not limited to:
* Disease transmission models;
* Multi-agent modelling;
* Epidemiology and public health;
* Semi-mechanistic modelling of infectious disease dynamics; and
* Any work within the intersection of ML and global health

The workshop will employ a double-anonymous review process. Each submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
* Soundness of the methodology;
* Novelty;
* Relevance to the workshop; and 
* Societal impacts

We only consider submissions that havenâ€™t been published in any peer-reviewed venue, including ICLR 2023 conference. We allow dual submission with other workshops or conferences. The workshop is non-archival and will not have any official proceedings. All accepted papers will be allocated either a poster presentation, or a talk slot.
